Wave is a free open source Minecraft anticheat solution, supporting bedrock players (Geyser) and versions from 1.8 all the way to 1.21!

If you wish to get support, test or have any questions about Wave, make sure to join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/rxV89DZHEd)!

## ðŸ“Ž Special Credits

Special credits to Nik and his [anticheat base](https://github.com/NikV2/AnticheatBase) that we are using! Thanks to retrooper too for making [packetevents](https://github.com/retrooper/packetevents) (that we are also using)! Thank you so much for your amazing work and dedication!

## ðŸ”” Releases/Updates

Wave has a built-in update checker, however it will not automatically install nor download the update, it will only send a message telling you if you are up to date or not. **Wave updates are ONLY RELEASED [HERE](https://github.com/XIII-MC/WaveAC)!**.

If you wish to compile Wave by yourself, know that you will most likely face issues, bugs, falses or even bypasses. Please only use **released** versions of Wave.

## ðŸš· Falses/Bypasses

**Most reports for falses or bypasses will only be accepted if they are working on our official test server.**
To report a false or bypass you may either use the issues section and following the provided templates OR open a ticket on our Discord server. **And no, we will not pay you just to have information on a false or a bypass.**

## ðŸš§ Test Server/Session

To test Wave on our official test server you may open a ticket on our Discord server with your in-game username and reason(s) of your testing. You may also ask how long you would like your test session to last, be realist and only ask for the time you actually need. If your test session expires or you are running out of time, reopen a ticket and ask for a time extension.

## ðŸ’¸ Donations

Since Wave is completly free to use we do not make any profits off of it, you can support us and our work by making a donation [here](https://paypal.me/waveac)! You'll receive the Donator role on our Discord server but also a permanent whitelist on our official test server (if you donated a total of 10â‚¬ or more)!
